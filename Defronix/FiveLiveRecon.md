## Classless Inter-Domain Routing(CIDR)
- It is an IP address allocation method that improves data routing efficiency on the internet
- Each machine, server and end-user device that connects to internet has a unique number called IP address
- Devices find and communicate with one another by using this IP addresses
- Organizations uses CIDR to allocate IP addresses flexibly and efficiently in their networks

## Autonomous System Number(ASN)
- It is a way to represent a collection of IPs and who owns them
- The IP address pool is spread across five regional internet registers(RIRs)
    - AFRINIC
    - APNIC
