- # Two types of website
	## Static Website
		
	- **Follow top to down approach**
	   - **First, find the technologies used - two tools**
		    - Wappalyzer
		    - Whatweb
				- Here, `Wappalyzer` gives more fault output. So, use `Whatweb` or `Manual` method (by checking source code)
	   - **After knowing technology focus on that technology test cases**
		- **At first check `P5` bugs (Best security practices) like what headers are missing, SSL, http connection**
			- For static page - first thing - find origin IP
			- If you find origin IP - there is WAF implemented into it - Which is `P4` bug
			- Second- perform directory busting
				- Directory busting types
					- `Normal`
					- `Recursive`
					- `Permuted`
			- ***If abc.com is static page then they hunt on this and go back. Stop and go searching for sub domains
			- Go to source code for hidden secrets, JS files
			- Next , go for Generic vulnerabilities - lets say website uses swagger UI and version used by that company has XSS in UI then go for hunting XSS
			- Next check, rate limits
			- Then, Broken link hijacking
			- Then, Web hooks- website allows us to book or schedule a call with their agents in calendar. But this was not linked with dashboard. So, I see linking ID of calendar and made similar account with same ID and I was able to get all particular schedules. This is `P1` bug because it is `PII` disclosure
			- Lets check, if they are internally hosted(means not using third party service) and has option to upload- try XSS via `png` or `jpg` or `pdf`, try path traversal, unsafe file upload
			- Next, try manual XSS, CRLF, admin panel disclosure
	## Dynamic Website
			- Follow all steps of static website
			- Then check signup
			- Forget password
			- Login
				- Pre-login
				- Post login(After login)
					- Unsafe file uploads
					- Broken access control
					- Privilege escalation
					- CSRF
					- XSS
					- Privacy Issue
					- Checklist
